Bug: the baby gorgon isn't always the same distance behind you. Not sure why.

Bug: chasing enemy following you in the mirror will sometimes reverse direction if there are multiple mirrors around

Bug: funny things going on with changing levels. If you go to the last level or a level without a down staircase and then try to use the PgUp PgDown button the game crashes

All the enemies should be gorgons. Or at least we should have moving gorgons.
