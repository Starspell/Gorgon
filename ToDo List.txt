Bug: the baby gorgon isn't always the same distance behind you. Not sure why.

Bug: going back into the final level gives you another baby gorgon. This one doesn't follow you creating a chain though :(

Bug: chasing enemy following you in the mirror will sometimes reverse direction if there are multiple mirrors around

BUg: funny things going on with staircases.

All the enemies should be gorgons. Or at least we should have moving gorgons.
